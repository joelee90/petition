DEBUGGING

1. Should I fix this bug right now?
    - Primary experiences - logging in / registering, signing the petition.
    - Secondary experiences - number of signers on 'thank-you' page doesn't show.
    - Every major website you visit has bugs.
2. Read the error message
    - note where the error appeared.
        - Did it appear in the Dev tools? Or in your Terminal?
        _ If you don't see an error message, that likely means you're not catching your errors!
3. Pinpoint where the bug is happening.
    - What was the expected behavior of this code? What did I think would happen?
    - What actually happened?
4. Sometimes, get frustrated, that's part of the learning process.
5. Try be yourself to fix the bug for at the very least 30 min.
6. Ask your peers for help.
    - ask classmates
    - rubber duck principle: discussing bug out loud can help you find it. Sometimes you need a peer to describe your bug at, and this is and of itself can help you discover the bug.
7. Ask a teacher
    - We should be your last resort.
    - spend a few minutes thinking about how to explain the bug.
    - Be specific about trouble I am having.
    - Demo the bug, know how to replicate the bug.
TAKE BREAKS!!!!!
