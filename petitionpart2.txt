I saved the id into 'req.session.sigId'

I want to use 'req.session.sigId'

find the corresponding signature and render
the signature(image) at signed handlebar.

In the db, the last person signed up, is the last no.


in db, there is id.

how can i find a way to render the corresponding id that
matches the signature.

id = 29
saved in req.session.sigId
---------------------------------------------------------

figured out the "id" of the current person.

in db, find the signature img corresponding to id.


link to signature is stored in db

now i know the id, need to find it in db

---------------------------------------------------------

in app.post('/petition')

Figure out the 'id' of the person who just signed up and save it into the cookie.

req.session.sigId = results.rows[0].id;

Go to db.js and make a new function which will find the corresponding siganture to the id.

exports.getSignatureImage = function getSignature(id) {
	return db.query(`SELECT signature FROM signings WHERE id = ${id}`);

Finding the signature which corresponds to the the id. Put id as an argument.

Go back to pet.js

Use the getSignatureImage function after the results of db.getSignaturesNum().

For getSignatureImage()'s argument, you want to put req.session.sigId which is the 'id'
saved in the cookie. And again use that results. 
If you console.log 'results' you get an object which has the url of the image (inside signature)

This can be accessed by 'results.rows[0].signature'.
